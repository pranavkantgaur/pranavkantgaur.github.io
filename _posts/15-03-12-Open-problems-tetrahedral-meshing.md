title: Open problems in Tetrahedral mesh generation
---

As has been the nature of articles listing _Open_ problems in any domain, expect this post to be under construction _forever_. I want to enter in the field of Tetrahedral mesh generation for which I am gathering the list of open problems. In this pursuit I have found some useful resources some of which I have listed [here](http://qr.ae/jW8pz). But I am expecting list to grow as I become more familiar with this field over time.

**Constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization(CDT)**  
* Is there any lower bound on number of _Steiner points_ required for edge recovery?  
* What is the _optimal_ number of Steiner points for a CDT?  

**Quality tetrahedral mesh generation**  
* Proof for Minimum/Maximum bound on dihedral angle in a Delaunay refinement is still unknown.
