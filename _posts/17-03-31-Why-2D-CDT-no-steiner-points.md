title: Why 2D CDT does not require steiner points?
---

In this post I would like to discuss a proof of the fact that although three dimensional Constrained Delaunay triangulation can be constructued from incremental modification of corresponding Delaunay triangulation, its 2D counter-part does not require such measures. That is, 2D CDT for a given set of constraints always exists.
