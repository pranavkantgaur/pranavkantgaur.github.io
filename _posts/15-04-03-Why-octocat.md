title: Why GitHub chose octocat?
---

One day while browsing whole variety of octocats available in [Octodex](https://octodex.github.com/), my mind started reasoning about why GitHub might have chosen Octocat as their mascot. Octocat is hybrid of cat and octopus, so how does it relate to programming?

In my opinion, Octocat provides best of both. Cats simply don't bother about their surrounding and even what people are trying to do with them. You can clearly see that in Youtube videos of cats. On the other hand, octopus have eight arms allowing them to manipulate multiple things or same thing in multiple ways at the same time. So, considering there traits of both I felt these are also _ideal_ characterstics of a programmer. 

A programmer when _programming_ doesnt give a damn at anything else(the _cat_ analogy), would always want to get as much work done as possible and would like to propose as many solutions to a problem as possible(the _eight arm_ analogy). So I then felt it _does_ makes some sense and decided to write this post :)
