title: Added new project site
---

I have now added a new github page for my project on Constrained Delaunay Teterahedralization. This is an [implementation](http://pranavkantgaur.github.io/CDTGenerator/) of a paper by Hang Si et. al. "Meshing Piecewise Linear Complexes using CDT". I have used CGAL extensively in this work especially Delaunay triangulation and Linear cell complex modules have been the most helpful ones.
